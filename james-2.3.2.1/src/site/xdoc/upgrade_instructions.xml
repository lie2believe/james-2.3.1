  <title>James 2.3 - Upgrading</title>
 </properties>
<body>
<section name="Upgrading Comments">
<p>James upgrading involves a number of steps, each of which is described in some detail in the 
following sections.  But as this sequence of steps has confused some users in the past, additional 
comments seem warranted.</p>
<p>It is important to realize that the James configuration files are not unpacked from the James 
distribution until the first time James is started.  This is a consequence of the design of the 
Avalon Phoenix container used to run James.  Once James has been started, the distribution will 
be unpacked.  The server should be stopped, the configuration files edited, and the server restarted.</p>
<p>So the Upgrading sequence is: <b>1) Start, 2) Stop, 3) Move 4) Edit, 5) Restart</b>.</p>

<p>Remove the apps/james/var directory and copy the apps/james/var directory of the old james 
installation in this place.</p>
</subsection>
</section>
<section name="Copy and modify config.xml">
<subsection name="Remove the fetchpop block">
<p>It's necessary to remove the fetchpop block in config.xml because fetchpop was removed in 2.3.</p>

<p>Add the following line as the first mailet of the "root" processor:</p>
<source> 
&lt;mailet match="All" class="PostmasterAlias"/&gt;
</source> 
<p>This was hardcoded in 2.2.0 and previous. Now we made it configurable.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection name="Move the spoolrepository config">
<p>Move the spoolrepository out of the mailstore. Its also necessary to change the config syntax. For example:</p>
<source>
&lt;spoolRepository&gt;
  &lt;repository destinationURL="db://maildb/spool/spool" type="SPOOL"/&gt;
&lt;/spoolRepository&gt;
</source>

&lt;!--
&lt;factory name="ssl" class="org.apache.avalon.cornerstone.blocks.sockets.TLSServerSocketFactory"&gt;
  &lt;ssl-factory&gt;
    &lt;keystore&gt;
      &lt;file&gt;conf/keystore/&lt;/file&gt;
      &lt;password&gt;secret&lt;/password&gt;
      &lt;key-password&gt;keysecret&lt;/key-password&gt;
      &lt;type&gt;JKS&lt;/type&gt;
      &lt;protocol&gt;TLS&lt;/protocol&gt;
      &lt;algorithm&gt;SunX509&lt;/algorithm&gt;
      &lt;authenticate-client&gt;false&lt;/authenticate-client&gt;
    &lt;/keystore&gt;
